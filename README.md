# Personal Website

This is my personal website implemened as a single page app in React and React-Router. It is mainly used for showing more about myself in professional experiences and skills set. 

To view the website, go to [http://ys2843.com](ys2843.com). 

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, 

+ First go to the directory in terminal and enter `npm install`.
+ Then enter `npm start`. You could visit the site on **localhost:3000** in browser.

### Deloyment

To deploy this project, to for example Amazon AWS S3, you could run `npm run-script build`, and upload the files in **build** directory to the server.

> You can only upload the files in build directory, but not the build directory.
